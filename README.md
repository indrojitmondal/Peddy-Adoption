 Project Description: Peddy Adoption is a user-friendly web application designed to connect potential pet adopters with pets in need of a loving home. Built with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, this platform allows users to browse through available pets and learn about their unique characteristics. Users can initiate the adoption process through a seamless interaction with an 'Adopt' button that opens a modal for more details. The project is developed using modern technologies like Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for an elegant and responsive design, ensuring an enjoyable user experience across devices.
