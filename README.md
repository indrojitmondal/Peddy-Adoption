Peddy Adoption is a user-friendly web application designed to connect potential pet adopters with pets in need of a loving home. Built with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, this platform allows users to browse through available pets and learn about their unique characteristics. Users can initiate the adoption process through a seamless interaction with an 'Adopt' button that opens a modal for more details. The project is developed using modern technologies like Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for an elegant and responsive design, ensuring an enjoyable user experience across devices.

### Built With

This project was built with the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Yarn to be installed in your system. If you don&#39;t have it installed, you can follow these steps:

- Install Yarn globally using npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal and run:

  ```sh
  npm install -g yarn
  ```

  Please ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed before running Yarn.

- Verify that Yarn has been installed on your machine by running the following command in your terminal:

  ```sh
  yarn --version
  ```

  If Yarn has been installed correctly, your terminal should display the version of Yarn installed on your machine.

Now you are ready to use Yarn for managing and versioning your project dependencies!

### Installation

Please follow the following steps for successful installation:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Get started by cloning the repository to your local machine.

   ```
   https://github.com/ShaanCoding/makeread.me
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Packages:** Navigate to the &quot;/frontend&quot; directory and install the required yarn packages by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Install Backend Packages:** Similarly, navigate to the &quot;/backend&quot; directory and install the required yarn packages by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment:**

   - In the &quot;/backend&quot; directory, copy the content of &quot;.env.example&quot; file and create a new file named &quot;.env&quot;. Adjust the environment variables according to your requirements or you can leave them as it is.

   - Navigate to &quot;frontend/api/generated/readMeGenerator.ts&quot; and set the BASE parameter to your backend API route. For instance, if you are running backend on your local server at port 8080, you should set:

     ```javascript
     BASE: "http://localhost:8080/api";
     ```

5. **Run the Backend:** Navigate to &quot;/backend&quot; directory and type the following command in your terminal to run your backend server:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

6. **Run the Frontend:** Finally, navigate to &quot;/frontend&quot; directory and type the following command in your terminal to run your frontend server:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

   Now, your application should be successfully up and running!
